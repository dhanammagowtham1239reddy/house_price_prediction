House price prediction involves using data and mathematical models to estimate the market value of a residential property. This is typically done by analyzing factors like location, size, number of bedrooms, historical sales data, and neighborhood characteristics. Machine learning algorithms are employed to build predictive models that learn from historical data to make future price predictions. The accuracy of these models is assessed using metrics like Mean Absolute Error or Root Mean Squared Error. House price prediction is valuable for real estate investment, property appraisal, and aiding buyers and sellers in making informed decisions in the housing market.
